# Welcome

This is a discussion space for creating a standard library for the [Terra](terralang.org) programming language, and hopefully at some point, the repository which will host the library itself.

We are at a very early stage in the process, so anyone who likes Terra is welcome to join the conversation and share ideas and code.

Feel free to use the Issues as a forum, and commit code directly to the repo so we can discuss on it.
If you prefer chatting, we also have a [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/terralang-stdlib/community).
Feel free to improve on anything, including this page.
